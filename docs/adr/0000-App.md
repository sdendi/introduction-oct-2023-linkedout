# Application Type - Backend for Frontend (BFF)

## Status

*Accepted*

## Context

Our user interface application is tightly coupled with the API. They will have almost identical rates of change. Our team will own both the user interface (`frontend`), and the API (`LinkedOutApi`). 

Changes in the frontend or backend will necessitate coordinated deployment.

## Decision

Because our User Interface and API will have a similiar rate of change, we will model our App as a "Backend For Frontend".

## Consequences

Our team will be able to iterate independently on requirements from the business. However, our API will not be a "shared" API, it is meant to be used only for this application. If other types of applications are built for the user interface, we may need to create new APIs for those applications.

The user interface (`frontend`) will communicate *primarily* with the BFF, however exceptions can be made especially when
communicating with other services for *reference data*. 

When and if needed, the BFF Api will coordinate the commands and events from the UI with other services.

This will also require our team to have skills in both frontend and backend development.
